    <p> 
        Early this morning before I went to sleep I got React to 
      talk to and display my Rails back-end for my project using 
      the Flatiron School practice example.
    </p>

    <p> 
        Today I intend to continue working on my project MVP, go to the 
      gym, make some calls, request the last of my school-related 
      time off from my Amazon job, attend my Flatiron School lecture, and 
      continue working on my weekly goals, such as working on my MVP 
      with progress noted.
